# My C# Dump

Okay, this time I've a good reason to create this one: there's a [free pro certification and course for C# on FreeCodeCamp dot org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/foundational-c-sharp-with-microsoft/). It's done by Microsoft or in collaboration or something. I might as well do it since I got nothing better to do AND it will look good in my CV AND I will not so bored since I *really* don't have anything better to do. Expect *quality shit code*.
